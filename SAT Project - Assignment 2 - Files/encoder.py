From SAT Assignment Part 1 - Non-consecutive Sudoku Encoder (Puzzle -> CNF)

Replace this code with your solution for assignment 1

Implement: to_cnf(input_path) -> (clauses, num_vars)

You're required to use a variable mapping as follows:
    var(r,c,v) = r*N*N + c*N + v
where r,c are in range (0...N-1) and v in (1...N).

You must encode:
  (1) Exactly one value per cell
  (2) For each value v and each row r: exactly one column c has v
  (3) For each value v and each column c: exactly one row r has v
  (4) For each value v and each sqrt(N)×sqrt(N) box: exactly one cell has v
  (5) Non-consecutive: orthogonal neighbors cannot differ by 1
  (6) Clues: unit clauses for the given puzzle
